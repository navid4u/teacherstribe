# 1. How to run tests?

## 1.1. Install Behat, Mink, and other dependencies in the project

Go to the root of the project and run:

```
composer install
```



## 1.2. Edit mock database credentials

- We use the file `tests/.env` to store the database credentials for the tests.
- This file is specific to your environment and is not committed.
- To create one, duplicate `tests/.env.dist` and edit credentials to suit your need.
- You don't have to create the mock database (default: `cruddiy_tests`), creating it is part of the tests.
- If your test user does not have the privileges to create a database, just create it and fill the credentials in the `.env`. If the database exists, we will not attempt to re-create it.


## 1.3. Run all tests (all suites)

Go to the root directory of the project and run `vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml`

```
germain@nuc13 UCRT64 /d/Sites/cruddiy
$ vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml  --stop-on-failure
   (...)

47 scénarios (47 succès)
449 étapes (449 succès)
0m46.61s (13.23Mb)
```

## 1.4. Run a specific suite of tests

- **Admin suite**: simulate the creation of a fresh CRUD
- **Public suite**: impersonate a user navigating on the generated CRUD pages
- **Regenarate suite**: when you regenerate the CRUD pages without re-typing/checking the options (options are saved as of PR #73)
- **Public After Regenerate suite**: this is a duplicate of Public suite. It's here because we want to check that the CRUD pages are still OK after a regeneration.

```
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite admin
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite public
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite regenerate_nogitignore
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite regenerate
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite public # or public_after_regenerate, it's a copy
```

## 1.5. Run a specific test

```
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml tests/behat/features/admin/relations/schema.feature
```

## 1.6. Stop on failure

You can stop the tests when the first failure arises:

```
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --suite admin --stop-on-failure
```




# 2. How to update the coverage list?

Read the coverage at [tests/coverage/admin.md](tests/coverage.md)

Update the coverage by executing:

```
vendor/bin/behat --config tests/behat/behat.yml --dry-run --no-snippets \
| grep -e '^Feature:' -e '^  Scenario:' \
| grep -o '^[^#]*' \
| sed 's/[[:space:]]*$//' \
| sed '/^Feature:/s/^/- /' \
| sed '/^  Scenario:/s/^/  - /' > tests/coverage.md
```







# 3. Test database schema

- For the tests we have a small structure with Products, Brands, and Suppliers
- `schema/Tests - Admin.sql` is the (nearly) blank structure, it is used to reset the test database every time you run the Admin test suite. It is also used to self-test the "Import Database Schema" feature.
- `schema/Tests - Public.sql` is a dump of the test DB after the Admin test suite has been run. It cleans up the DB every time the Public test suite is run (because the suite is performing CRUD operations, which would invalidate some tests when re-run).






# 4. Adding new tests

- To find a list of predefined assertions from the Mink extension, open `vendor\behat\mink-extension\src\Behat\MinkExtension\Context\MinkContext.php`
- Test your `.feature` files individually
- Then add them to the queue in `behat.yml`





# 5. Log tests

- Every time a test fails, a .html dump of the response is saved in `tests/behat/logs`.
- You can open the files in your browser to view the state of the application when the test ran, including PHP error messages and exceptions.
- The logs directory is deleted every time a new batch of tests is ran.
- The name of the log file mimics the Behat files in the `features/` directory, eg.:
  - Step fails in tests\behat\features\admin\relations\schema.feature line 16
  - Name of the log file: admin_relations_schema-16.html
- There is also a custom step definition **Then I log the content of the page** that will log a page even if there is no error



# 6. Write your own tests

All developers are encouraged to write tests as they contribute to the project, it's easy and fun! And satisfactory!
